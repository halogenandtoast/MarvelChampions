# Running locally

If you have docker installed, you can get an instance running by running

```
docker-compose up
```

And then opening <http://localhost:3000> in your browser once it is finished.
Please be aware it takes a long time to build initially and you'll want docker
to have ~16GB or RAM and ~30GB of disk space allocated.
